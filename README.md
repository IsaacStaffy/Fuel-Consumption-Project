### Fuel-Consumption-Project
Link to webpage: https://fuel-estimator.streamlit.app/


This app is a fuel consumption estimator that predicts city and highway fuel usage. Using machine learning, it takes various vehicle specification inputs and returns estimates for city and highway fuel consumption, as well as carbon emissions. A vehicle catalog is included, offering extensive specifications for a wide range of vehicles. While it may not cover every model, it should suffice in most cases. 

# 1: Input Vehicle Specifications: First enter in your vehicle’s specifications in the side panel.

# 2: Run: Next, select the units you want, select the precision, and click Run.

# 3: Additional info: Third, enter additional stats like a rough estimate of gas price as well as gas tank size.

## 4: Trip Calculator: -- two options  
# A: Enter in trip mileage manually and provide highway to city road ratio.

Depending on route length searching for gas stations may take a minute

# 6: Carbon Offset: Your total emissions as well as the donation amount to offset them is calculated and provided at the bottom.  
Cool Effect is a great place to donate to offset emissions — Check it out here: [Visit Cool Effect](https://www.cooleffect.org/).
